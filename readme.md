# Azure Cloud Challenge Frontend

This HTML  was created as part of the Cloud Resume Challenge and is hosted at [https://heyitsadam.com](heyitsadam.cloud)

This page shows a counter that is implemented using JavaScript and a backend made up of a Azure Function App using Python and a Cosmos DB.

Also implemented a Azure Workflow using Github Actions which will upload to the storage account and purge the CDN cache when changes are made to the code base. This uses an app and service principal for authentication between Github and Azure.
